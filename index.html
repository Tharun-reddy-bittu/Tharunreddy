    <li>Marinate the Chicken:
        In a large bowl, combine minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and black pepper.
        Add the sliced chicken thighs to the marinade and toss until evenly coated. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or ideally overnight for more flavor.</li>
    <li>Preheat the Oven or Grill:
         Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) or preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Skewer the Chicken (Optional):
         If using skewers, thread the marinated chicken slices onto skewers. This step is optional; you can also cook the chicken directly on a grill pan or baking sheet.</li>

        If using skewers, place them on the preheated grill or in the oven. Cook for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and nicely browned.

    <li>Rest and Slice:
        Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill or oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Then, thinly slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
     <li>   Assemble the Shawarma:
        Warm your pita bread or flatbreads briefly in the oven or on the grill.
        Place some sliced chicken down the center of each pita or flatbread.
        Add any desired toppings, such as sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, tahini sauce, garlic sauce, pickles, etc.</li>
      <li>  Roll and Serve:
        Roll up the pita bread or flatbread tightly around the filling to form a wrap or sandwich.
